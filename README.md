# Learning Python Repository
This repository is dedicated to learning Python. 
It includes various materials used for learning and practice, as well as a special folder named *DataAnalysisCourse* containing materials and exercises from a Udemy course. 
Additionally, it features exercises that I have completed and uploaded over time.
